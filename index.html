			<h1>Welcome to the website for the Scratch Forum Helpers!</h1>
			<h2>Who are the Scratch Forum Helpers?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We are a small group of people who help around the Scratch forums daily. We mostly help answering questions, answer bug reports, give our thoughts on suggestions by scratchers from all over the world. We don't "police" the forums, but only help around!</p>
			<h2>I want to be a Forum Helper. How do I apply?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We're glad that you're interested in applying! We are always on the lookout for new members! However, there is a requirement, which is that you must have at least 100 posts to apply. In order to apply, please go to the Forum Helpers Studio (There is a link in the header), and fill out the application listed in the description of the studio.</p>
			<h2>What forums are the Forum Helpers most active in?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">Generally we help out in the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/" class="FHULink">Suggestions</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/" class="FHULink">Bugs And Glitches</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/4/" class="FHULink">Questions About Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/7/" class="FHULink">Help With Scripts</a> Forums.
			<h2>I submitted my application! Now what?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">Once you submit an application, three of the Studio Managers will look at your application and grade it out of 10 points. The scores will be added together. You must get at least 24 to join. If you don't get the number, you may reapply in a week!</p>
